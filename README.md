# StarkNFT Contract

## Overview

Welcome to the StarkNFT contract, a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) implementation on the StarkNet blockchain using the Cairo programming language. This contract adheres to the ERC-721 standard, providing a basic framework for creating and managing unique tokens on the StarkNet platform.

## Features

- ERC-721 compliant: Supports the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.
- Minting: Allows the creation of new tokens.
- Transfer and Approval: Enables secure transfer of tokens between addresses with proper approval mechanisms.
- Metadata: Provides functions to retrieve token metadata like name, symbol, and URI.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the StarkNFT contract, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Deploy the contract on the StarkNet blockchain.

2. **Minting Tokens:**
   - Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.

3. **Interact with Tokens:**
   - Transfer tokens between addresses using `safeTransferFrom` or `transferToken`.
   - Approve or set approval for all operators using `approveAddress` and `setApprovalForAll`.

## Contract Structure

The contract is organized into sections:

- **Storage:** Defines the contract's storage structure.
- **Constructor:** Initializes the contract upon deployment.
- **External Functions:** Publicly accessible functions for interacting with the contract.
- **ERC721 Metadata and ERC721 Functions:** Implementations of the ERC-721 Metadata and ERC-721 standards.
- **ERC165 Functions:** Implements the ERC-165 standard for contract interface support.
- **Internal Functions:** Helper functions for internal contract operations.

## Usage

Example code snippets for common interactions with the StarkNFT contract:

- Minting a new token:
  ```python
  mint(<to: Address>)
  ```

- Transferring a token:
  ```python
  safeTransferFrom(<from: Address>, <to: Address>, <token_id: u256>, <data: Array<u8>>)
  ```

- Getting token metadata:
  ```python
  getTokenName()
  ```
