## Features

- ERC-721 compliant: Supports the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.
- Minting: Allows the creation of new tokens.
- Transfer and Approval: Enables secure transfer of tokens between addresses with proper approval mechanisms.
- Metadata: Provides functions to retrieve token metadata like name, symbol, and URI.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the StarkNFT contract, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Deploy the contract on the StarkNet blockchain.

2. **Minting Tokens:**
   - Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.

3. **Interact with Tokens:**
   - Transfer tokens between addresses using `safeTransferFrom` or `transferToken`.
   - Approve or set approval for all operators using `approveAddress` and `setApprovalForAll`.

## Contract Structure

The contract is organized into sections:

- **Storage:** Defines the contract's storage structure.
- **Constructor:** Initializes the contract upon deployment.
- **External Functions:** Publicly accessible functions for interacting with the contract.
- **ERC721 Metadata and ERC721 Functions:** Implementations of the ERC-721 Metadata and ERC-721 standards.
- **ERC165 Functions:** Implements the ERC-165 standard for contract interface support.
- **Internal Functions:** Helper functions for internal contract operations.

## Usage

Example code snippets for common interactions with the StarkNFT contract:

- Minting a new token:
  ```python
  mint(<to: Address>)
  ```

- Transferring a token:
  ```python
  safeTransferFrom(<from: Address>, <to: Address>, <token_id: u256>, <data: Array<u8>>)
  ```

- Getting token metadata:
  ```python
  getTokenName()
  ```

First and foremost, I embarked on writing for the StarkNet ecosystem due to its developer-centric approach. The tremendous efforts invested in making it enticing for builders to venture into creating with these novel technologies are truly commendable. This instills vast prospects for the project, and naturally, it captivates me as a developer.

This project represents one of my initial forays into the realm of Web3. It serves as a foundation around which I aspire to continue building an ecosystem, nurturing its growth, and drawing in users who can benefit from its offerings. I am confident that, with such a formidable team, we can collectively forge something monumental, and I am eager to contribute as a crucial part of this endeavor.

The commitment to fostering an environment that not only attracts developers but also sustains their interest is a testament to the project's dedication to innovation. As I reflect on the vast potential that StarkNet holds, I am motivated to contribute my skills and expertise to help shape its future.

I envision playing a pivotal role in the ongoing development of this project, utilizing my experiences from one of my initial Web3 ventures. The prospect of being part of a dynamic and expansive team, working collectively towards a shared vision, is both exciting and motivating. Together, I believe we can propel this project to new heights and establish a lasting impact within the Web3 landscape.
